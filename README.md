LED Cube Library
================

This is a small library for a 4x4x4 LED cube.

The cube status is stored in a 3-dimensional array and then painted via multiplexing the different layers.

Some simple example patterns are included.

Mapping between the microcontroller output pins and the library can be configured.

**Note:** At the moment this is under high development and may completly change. Not even near stable.
See http://www.instructables.com/id/LED-Cube-4x4x4/ for reliable code :-).
